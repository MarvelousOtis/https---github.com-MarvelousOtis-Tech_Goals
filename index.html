      <h2>Tech Goals (Next 2 Years)</h2>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">In the first year, I aim to deepen my understanding of modern front-end frameworks such as React, Angular, and Vue.js.
    This will involve not only studying their core concepts but also building sophisticated, user-friendly web applications. By engaging in hands-on projects,
    participating in coding challenges, and contributing to open-source initiatives, I will gain practical experience and showcase my proficiency. Additionally,
    attending workshops, webinars, and tech conferences focused on these technologies will provide valuable insights and networking opportunities. My objective 
    is to become adept at creating dynamic, responsive web interfaces that enhance user experiences.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">In the second year, I plan to expand my expertise to include back-end technologies and server-side programming. Learning 
        languages like Node.js, Python, and Ruby, along with mastering databases such as MongoDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL, will be crucial. I will work on building
         full-stack applications, understanding the complete web development process from server management to API integration and database interaction. To achieve 
         this, I will take various online courses, collaborate with experienced developers, and take on freelance projects to apply these skills in real-world 
         scenarios. By becoming proficient in both front-end and back-end development, I aim to transform into a versatile and competitive web developer.
